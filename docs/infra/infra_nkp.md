# Deploy NKP Clusters

This section will take you through install NKP(Kubernetes) on Nutanix cluster as we will be deploying AI applications on these kubernetes clusters.

We will use the [CAPI](https://cluster-api.sigs.k8s.io/) based deployment of NKP. This will automatically deploy the required infrastructure VMs for the cluster by connecting to Nutanix Cluster APIs. There is no requirement to use Terraform or or other IaC tools to deploy NKP.

This section will expand to other available Kubernetes implementations on Nutanix.

!!! warning "Deploying NKP Cluster"

    This lab will focus on deploying NKP to host NAI workloads. However, the steps can also be used deploy a custom NKP deployment if that's the aim.

    We will only deploy 1 (one) NKP cluster and have the management and workload part in this. For production environments, it is advised to have separate NKP clusters for management and workloads.

    Consider using [NKP The Hard Way](../appendix/infra_nkp_hard_way.md) section to create a customized version of your NKP cluster with separate NKP clusters for management and workloads.

    Once you have determined the resource requirements for a custom NKP deployment, modify the environment variables and values in the ``.env`` file to suit your resource needs for your NKP cluster.

## NKP High Level Cluster Design

The ``nkpdev`` cluster will be hosting the LLM model serving endpoints and AI application stack. This cluster and will require a dedicated GPU node pool.

### Sizing Requirements

Below are the sizing requirements needed to successfully deploy NAI on a NKP Cluster (labeled as ``nkpdev``) and subsequently deploying single LLM inferencing endpoint on NAI using the `meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct` LLM model.

??? Tip "Calculating GPU Resources Tips"

    The calculations below assume that you're already aware of how much memory is required to load target LLM model.

    For a general example:

    - To host a 8b(illion) parameter model, multiply the parameter number by 2 to get minimum GPU memory requirments. 
      e.g. 16GB of GPU memory is required for 8b parameter model.
  
    > So in the case of the `meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct` model, you'll need a min. 16 GiB GPU vRAM available

    Below are additional sizing consideration "Rule of Thumb" for further calculating min. GPU node resources:

    - For each GPU node will have 8 CPU cores, 24 GB of memory, and 300 GB of disk space.
    - For each GPU attached to the node, add 16 GiB of memory.
    - For each endpoint attached to the node, add 8 CPU cores.
    - If a model needs multiple GPUs, ensure all GPUs are attached to the same worker node
    - For resiliency, while running multiple instances of the same endpoint, ensure that the GPUs are on different worker nodes.

Since we will be testing with the ``meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct`` HuggingFace model, we will require a GPU with a min. of 24 GiB GPU vRAM available to support this demo.

!!! note
    GPU min. vRAM should be 24 GB, such as NVIDIA L4 Model.

Below are minimum requirements for deploying NAI on the NKP Demo Cluster.

| Role          | No. of Nodes (VM) | vCPU per Node | Memory per Node | Storage per Node | Total vCPU | Total Memory |
|---------------|-------------------|---------------|-----------------|------------------|------------|--------------|
| Control plane | 3                 | 4             | 16 GB           | 150 GB           | 12         | 48 GB        |
| Worker        | 4                 | 8             | 32 GB           | 150 GB           | 32         | 128 GB       |
| GPU           | 1                 | 16            | 40 GB           | 300 GB           | 16         | 40 GB        |
| **Totals**    |                   |               |                 |                  | **60**     | **216 GB**   |

         Configure a credential helper to remove this warning. See
         https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/login/#credential-stores
         ```

2. Open the docker login URL in a browser after you enter the ``docker login`` command.

## Reserve Control Plane and MetalLB IP

Nutanix AHV IPAM network allows you to black list IPs that needs to be reserved for specific application endpoints. We will use this feature to find and reserve three IPs. 

We will reserve a total of three IPs for the following:

| Cluster Role | Cluster Name |       NKP        | NAI |
|--------------|--------------|------------------|-----|
| Dev          | `nkpdev`     |       2          | 1   |

1. Get the CIDR range for the AHV network(subnet) where the application will be deployed

    ```buttonless title="CIDR example for your Nutanix cluster"
    10.x.x.0/24
    ```

2. From VSC, logon to your jumpbox VM and open Terminal

3. Install ``nmap`` tool (if not already done)

    ```bash
    cd $HOME/sol-cnai-infra
    devbox add nmap
    ```

4. Find three unused static IP addresses in the subnet

    === "Command"

        ```bash
        nmap -v -sn  <your CIDR>
        ```

    === "Sample command"

        ```bash 
        nmap -v -sn 10.x.x.0/24
        ```

    ```text title="Sample output - choose the first three consecutive IPs"
    Nmap scan report for 10.x.x.214 [host down]
    Nmap scan report for 10.x.x.215 [host down]
    Nmap scan report for 10.x.x.216 [host down]
    Nmap scan report for 10.x.x.217
    Host is up (-0.098s latency).
    ```

5. Logon to any CVM in your Nutanix cluster and execute the following to add chosen static IPs to the AHV IPAM network

    - **Username:** nutanix
    - **Password:** your Prism Element password 

    === "Command"

        ```text
        acli net.add_to_ip_blacklist <your-ipam-ahv-network> \
        ip_list=10.x.x.214,10.x.x.215,10.x.x.216
        ```

    === "Sample command"

         ```text
         acli net.add_to_ip_blacklist User1 \
         ip_list=10.x.x.214,10.x.x.215,10.x.x.216
         ```

### Reservation of IPs

Reserve the firs IPs for NKP control plane 
Reserve the second two IPs for MetalLB distributed load balancer
- We will use one of these IP for NAI

Reserve the third IP for NAI. We will use the NAI IP in the next [NAI](../iep/iep_deploy.md#install-ssl-certificate) section to assign the FDQN and install SSL certificate.

|   Component            |  IP                          | FQDN |
|  ------------          | --------                     |------|
| NKP Control Plane VIP  |  ``10.x.x.214``              | -    |
| NKP MetalLB IP Range   |  ``10.x.x.215-10.x.x.216``   | -    |
| NAI                    |  ``10.x.x.216``              | ``nai.10.x.x.216.nip.io``|

## Create Base Image for NKP

!!! tip "About NKP Base Image OS Version on Nutanix Cluster"
    
    The base image for NKP is a minimal image that contains the required packages and tools to run the Kubernetes cluster. The base image is used to create the worker node VMs and the control plane VMs.

    NKP base image can be ``Rocky Linux 9.4`` image and is part of ``NKP Starter`` license. This image is maintained and supported by Nutanix. The image is updated regularly to include the latest security patches and bug fixes. Customers **should not** modify the base image. 

    Using ```NKP Pro``` license also offers choice of using ``Ubuntu 22.04`` base image for GPU based workload deployments.

In this section we will go through creating a base image for all the control plane and worker node VMs on Nutanix. We will use the ``Ubuntu 22.04`` image as the base image as we will need GPU support for AI applications. NVIDIA GPU drivers are not yet available for ``Rocky Linux 9.4`` base image. 

!!! info "NKP Cloud Support"
    
    For information about other supported operating systems for Nutanix Kubernetes Platform (NKP), see [NKP Cloud Support](https://portal.nutanix.com/page/documents/details?targetId=Nutanix-Kubernetes-Platform-v2_12:Nutanix-Kubernetes-Platform-v2_12).

1. In VSC Explorer pane, Click on **New Folder** :material-folder-plus-outline:

2. Call the folder ``nkp`` under ``$HOME`` directory

3. In the ``nkp`` folder, click on **New File** :material-file-plus-outline: and create new file with the following name:
  
    ```bash
    .env
    ```

4. Run the following command to generate an new RSA key pair on the jumphost VM. This SSH key pair will be used for authentication between the jumphost and NKP K8S cluster nodes.
   
    ??? tip "Do you have existing SSH key pair?"

        Copy the key pair from your workstation (PC/Mac) to `~/.ssh/` directory on your Jumphost VM.
        
        ``` { .bash .no-copy }
        mac/pc $ scp ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub ubuntu@10.x.x.171:~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
        mac/pc $ scp ~/.ssh/id_rsa ubuntu@10.x.x.171:~/.ssh/id_rsa
        ```

    ```bash
    ssh-keygen -t rsa
    ```
    
    Accept the default file location as ``~/.ssh/id_rsa``
    
    SSH key pair will stored in the following location:
        
    ``` { .bash .no-copy }
    ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub 
    ~/.ssh/id_rsa
    ```

    
5. Fill the following values inside the ``.env`` file

    ```

!!!note

    In this lab the workload cluster will have the Management cluster role as well to reduce resource consumption in a lab environment. 

    However, for production environments, the ideal design is to have a separate management and workload clusters. 

1. Open .env file in VSC and add (append) the following environment variables to your ``.env`` file and save it

        ```

        If the values are incorrect, add the correct values to ``.env`` and source the  again by running the following command

        ```bash
        source $HOME/nkp/.env
        ```

        Then rerun the ``echo nkp`` command to verify the values again before running the ``nkp create cluster nutanix`` command.

    !!! info "What is a Self-Manged Cluster?"

        The ``--self-managed`` argument of the ``nkp create cluster nutanix`` command will deploy bootstrap, and Kommander management automatically. 
        
        The appendix section has information on how to deploy a cluster without using the ``--self-managed`` option. 

        Usually preferred by customer DevOps teams to have more control over the deployment process. This way the customer can do the following:
        
        - Deploy bootstrap (``Kind``) cluster
        - Deploy NKP Management cluster
        - Choose to migrate the CAPI components over to NKP Management cluster
        - Choose to customize Kommander Managment component instllation
        - Choose to deploy workload clusters from NKP Kommander GUI or
        - Choose to deploy workload clusters using scripts to automate the process
        
        See [NKP the Hard Way](../appendix/infra_nkp_hard_way.md) section for more information for customizable NKP cluster deployments. 
  
4. Observe the events in the shell and in Prism Central events

5. Store kubeconfig file for ``nkpdev`` cluster
   
    ```bash
    export KUBECONFIG=$HOME/nkp/nkpdev.conf
    ```

6. Confirm the access to ``nkpdev`` cluster
 
    === "Command"
    
        ```bash
        kubectl get nodes
        ```

    === "Command Output"

## Licensing

We need to generate a license for the NKP cluster which is the total for all the vCPUs used by worker nodes.

For example, in the [Sizing Requirements](#sizing-requirements) section, the NKP Demo Cluster `Total vCPU count` is equal to ``60``, whereas the actual worker nodes total vCPU count is only `48`.

#### Generate NKP Pro License

To generate a NKP Pro License for the NKP cluster:

!!! note

    Nutanix Internal users should logon using Nutanix SSO

    Nutanix Partners/Customers should logon to Portal using their Nutanix Portal account credentials

1. Login to [Nutanix Portal](https://portal.nutanix.com/page/licensing) using your credentials
2. Go to **Licensing** > **License Summary**
3. Click on the small drop down arrow :material-chevron-down: on Manage Licenses and choose Nutanix Kubernetes Platform (NKP)
4. Input the NKP cluster name
5. Click on the plus icon :material-plus:
6. Click on **Next** in the bottom right corner
7. Select NKP Pro License

12. Click on **Save**
13. Download the csv file and store it in a safe place

#### Applying NKP Pro License to NKP Cluster

1. Login to the Kommander URL for ``nkpdev`` cluster with the generated credentials that was generated in the previous [section](../infra/infra_nkp.md#create-nkp-workload-cluster). The following commands will give you the credentials and URL.

    === "Command"

        ```bash
        nkp get dashboard
        ```

    === "Command Output"

        ```{ .bash .no-copy }
        nkp get dashboard

        Username: recursing_xxxxxxxxx

7. The license will be applied to the cluster and the license status will reflect NKP Pro in the top right corner of the dashboard
   
## Add NKP GPU Workload Pool

!!!tip "CPU only LLM Hosting"

    Enabling GPU and NVIDIA GPU Operator in NKP is not essential for NAI ``v2.3``

    NAI ``v2.3`` can host LLM up to 7 billion parameters on CPU

!!!warning
     
    Skip this section if no GPUs are required

The steps below covers the following:
    - Retrieving and Applying NKP Pro License
    - Identifying the GPU device name
    - Deploying the GPU nodepool
    - Enabling the NVIDIA GPU Operator

!!! note
    To Enable the GPU Operator afterwards using the NKP Marketplace, a minimal NKP Pro license is required.

### Find GPU Device Details

As we will be deploying Nutanix Enterprise AI (NAI) in the next section, we need to find the GPU details beforehand.

Find the details of GPU on the Nutanix cluster while still connected to Prism Central (PC).

1. Logon to Prism Central GUI
2. On the general search, type **GPUs**
3. Click on the **GPUs** result

    ![](images/cluster_gpu_info.png)

4. ``Lovelace 40s`` is the GPU available for use
5. Use ``Lovelace 40s`` in the evironment variables in the next section.

### Create NKP GPU Workload Pool

In this section we will create a nodepool to host the AI apps with a GPU.

1. Open .env file in VSC and add (append) the following environment variables to your ``.env`` file and save it

    === "Template .env"

        ```text
        export GPU_NAME=_name_of_gpu_device_
        export GPU_REPLICA_COUNT=_no_of_gpu_worker_nodes
        export GPU_POOL=_name_of_gpu_pool
        export GPU_NODE_VCPUS=_no_of_gpu_node_vcpus
        export GPU_NODE_CORES_PER_VCPU=_per_gpu_node_cores_per_vcpu
        export GPU_NODE_MEMORY_GIB=_per_gpu_node_memory_gib
        export GPU_NODE_DISK_SIZE_GIB=_per_gpu_node_memory_gib
        ```

    === "Sample .env"

        ```text
        export GPU_NAME="Lovelace 40S"
        export GPU_REPLICA_COUNT=1
        export GPU_POOL=gpu-nodepool
        export GPU_NODE_VCPUS=16
        export GPU_NODE_CORES_PER_VCPU=1
        export GPU_NODE_MEMORY_GIB=40
        export GPU_NODE_DISK_SIZE_GIB=200
        ```

2. Source the new variables and values to the environment

     ```bash
     source $HOME/nkp/.env
     ```

3. Run the following command to create a GPU nodepool manifest

    ```bash
    nkp create nodepool nutanix \
        --cluster-name ${NKP_CLUSTER_NAME} \
        --prism-element-cluster ${NUTANIX_CLUSTER} \
        --subnets ${NUTANIX_SUBNET_NAME} \
        --vm-image ${NKP_IMAGE} \
        --disk-size ${GPU_NODE_DISK_SIZE_GIB} \
        --memory ${GPU_NODE_MEMORY_GIB} \
        --vcpus ${GPU_NODE_VCPUS} \
        --cores-per-vcpu ${GPU_NODE_CORES_PER_VCPU} \
        --replicas ${GPU_REPLICA_COUNT} \
        --wait \
        ${GPU_POOL} --dry-run -o yaml > gpu-nodepool.yaml
    ```

    !!! note

        Right now there is no switch for GPU in ``nkp`` command. We need to do dry-run the output into a file and then add the necessary GPU specifications

4. Add the necessary gpu section to our new ``gpu-nodepool.yaml`` using ``yq`` command

    ```bash
    yq e '(.spec.topology.workers.machineDeployments[] | select(.name == "gpu-nodepool").variables.overrides[] | select(.name == "workerConfig").value.nutanix.machineDetails) += {"gpus": [{"type": "name", "name": strenv(GPU_NAME)}]}' -i gpu-nodepool.yaml
    ```

    ??? success "Successful addtion of GPU specs?"

        You would be able to see the added gpu section at the end of the ``gpu-nodepool.yaml`` file

        ```yaml hl_lines="29"
        apiVersion: cluster.x-k8s.io/v1beta1
        kind: Cluster

        <snip>

                          name: Lovelace 40S
        ```

4. Monitor Cluster-Api resources (on a different shell) to ensure gpu machine will be successfully created

    ```bash
    watch kubectl get cluster-api
    ```

5. Apply the ``gpu-nodepool.yaml`` file to the workload cluster

    ```bash
    kubectl apply -f gpu-nodepool.yaml
    ```

6. Monitor the progress of the command and check Prism Central events for creation of the GPU worker node

7. Check nodes status in workload ``nkpdev`` cluster and note the gpu worker node

    === "Command"

        ```bash
        kubectl get nodes -w
        ```

    === "Command Output"

        ```bash hl_lines="4"
        $ kubectl get nodes

10. Run a sample GPU workload to confirm GPU operations

    === "Command"

        ```bash
        kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
        apiVersion: v1
        kind: Pod
        metadata:
          name: cuda-vector-add
        spec:
          restartPolicy: OnFailure
          containers:
          - name: cuda-vector-add
            image: k8s.gcr.io/cuda-vector-add:v0.1
            resources:
              limits:
                nvidia.com/gpu: 1
        EOF
        ```

    === "Command Output"

        ```{ .text, no-copy}
        pod/cuda-vector-add created
        ```

11. Follow the logs to check if the GPU operations are successful

    === "Command"

        ```bash
        kubectl logs _gpu_worload_pod_name
        ```
    === "Sample Command"

        ```bash
        kubectl logs cuda-vector-add-xxx
        ```

    === "Command Output"

        ```{ .text, no-copy}
        kubectl logs cuda-vector-add
        [Vector addition of 50000 elements]
